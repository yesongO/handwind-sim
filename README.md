## Overview

HandWind-Sim is an interactive framework that recognizes user hand gestures via a standard webcam to interact with a 3D cloth simulation in real-time, directly in the browser. This project aims to increase the accessibility of complex physics-based interactions for applications in HCI research, interactive art, and virtual prototyping.

## Features

- **üñ•Ô∏è Real-time Web Simulation:** Provides a real-time cloth simulation that runs directly in modern web browsers without any installation required.
- **üëã Intuitive Gesture Interaction:** Recognizes user hand movements via a standard webcam and translates them into an intuitive wind vector to control the simulation.
- **üìä Interactive Visual Feedback:** Offers a visual feedback system for the generated wind (direction and strength) and the tracked hand position, providing an immersive and understandable experience.

## How It Works (Architecture)

HandWind-Sim utilizes a pipeline architecture where modules for gesture input, physics simulation, and rendering are organically connected.

1.  **Gesture Input & Processing:** Extracts hand landmarks from the webcam video stream using MediaPipe and analyzes the movement to generate a wind vector.
2.  **Physics Simulation:** Simulates the deformation of the cloth mesh based on the generated wind vector and physical constraints, using a Position-Based Dynamics (PBD) algorithm.
3.  **Rendering & Visualization:** Renders all 3D elements, including the deformed cloth, tracked hand, and wind effects, using Three.js to provide visual feedback to the user.

## Requirements

-   A modern web browser with WebGL support (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
-   A webcam.

<br>

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
    -   For the best experience and to avoid potential browser security issues with local files, it is recommended to use a local server. A simple way is to use an extension like **Live Server** in Visual Studio Code.
